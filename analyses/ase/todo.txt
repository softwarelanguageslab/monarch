ASE TODO
---------

- [X] allocate the TAdr in the store, same for VAdr and SAdr
- [X] Create a TopLifted instance of the Scheme lattice, this 
will help us in achieving the most generic values that could 
be returned from the model in our symbolic solver
- [ ]Â check why `freshmodel.scm` does not seem to terminate on the local variant 
of the analysis.
