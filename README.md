![Monarch](monarch-logo.png)

## Goal

Monarch is the successor of [MAF](https://github.com/softwarelanguageslab/maf) a framework for experimenting with modular static analyses that are based on abstract interpretation. 
This iteration of the framework focusses on monadic implementations of the so-called "Abstracting Definitional Interpreters" (Darais et al., 2017) technique to static analysis.

MAF focussed on static analyses developed according to the ModX technique.
While this current iteration of the framwork still includes an implementation of the algorithms used 
in this ModX technique, its analyses are not structured in this way. Rather, ModX is viewed as an intelligent worklist algorithm provided as a parameter to the analysis' implementation.

## Usage 

**This section is a work in progress**

The framework can be used in a standalone mode by interacting with it through a command line interface.  This command line interface currently offers some basic analyses for Scheme and some utilities for testing parsing of Python programs. This CLI is offered by the `maf2-analysis` package, and can be executed by running `cabal run` in this package.

Alternatively, the repository can be used as a set of libraries. This usage is illustrated by [this](examples/maf2-lambda/) package, which implements a simple analysis for the extended lambda calculus. It also contains a suitable _cabal_ configuration to load our set of libraries from this repository through Github's infrastructure. 

## Structure

The project is structured as a monorepository containing several independent libraries.
The idea behind this structure is to enable re-use of each of the components in our 
framework, allowing them to be easily used in smaller experiments. The libraries
that make up our framework are as follows:

* `maf2-domains`: this library contains some core abstract domains that are used in 
our analyses. These abstract domains are underpinned by abstract interpretation theory
and are formulated in terms of mathematical lattices.
* `maf2-syntax`: this library contains syntax parsing and preprocessing facilities 
for all targets of our analyses. Our analyses currently target Scheme and Python.
* `maf2-analysis`: this library contains our analyses.

Each library contains additional documentation about their structure and usage
in third-party libraries/applications.

## References and Relevant publications

Monarch has been presented at SAS 2025 in a paper entitled "Monarch, A Modular Framework for Abstract Definitional Interpreters in Haskell".

The original idea behind ModX comes from the following work on modular analysis: [Effect-Driven Flow Analysis](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-11245-5_12), and [A general method for rendering static analyses for diverse concurrency models modular](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2018.10.001).

The previous iteration of the MAF framework is presented in the following publication:

MAF is a complete rework of the [Scala-AM framework](https://github.com/acieroid/scala-am), which was not focused on
modular static analysis but was primarily used to experiment with AAM-style analyses. An [AAM implementation](docs/AAM.md) (inspired by Scala-AM) is provided in MAF for benchmarks comparisons. Scala-AM is described in the
following publications:
